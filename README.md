## Setup

Start by **forking** this repo then clone it on your machine with nodejs installed.

Go to the `fluff.config.js` file and start _naming_ your website and _write_ a description.

You can change the author, it's you now, this code is MIT, just keep the License for other to find and go wild.

Change the look and feel of the website in the `styles/globals.css` file, there are some themes, make your own.

Replace the images in `public` with your assets, or grab some from [Pexels.com](https://pexels.com) like I did.

Install the dependencies using `npm install`

Start the server using `npm run dev`

## This is my blog

Write your own **projects.mdx** in `pages/projects/` and they will get sourced.

_Link up_ an API for the blog, or use the projects code to start blogging in mdx.

Add pages and links to the config AND translations, add social hooks.

_Deploy_ your repo anywhere !

## Going further

Implement Searching, catégories, auto tag catégories, comments, code localized projects ...

## Default Readme kept Below

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
