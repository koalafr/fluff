## Technologies

Fluff is built with Javascript, HTML5 and CSS5 all powered by [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and fueled by [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) / [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) / [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) ecosystem.

It also uses mdx with [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to enable richer static page content.

This combination allows for a steady start but infinite complexity if need be, sky is the limit.

Nextjs [powers giants like tiktok or twitch](https://nextjs.org/showcase)

## Easy peasy

Mdx is meant for the static content, but nothing stops us from fetching the data from other sources as well I use Json PlaceHolder and Lorem Picsum in this template.

Bundled with some helper packages like react-icons or line-clamp this is an all-in-one template made to scale.
