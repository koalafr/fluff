Every writer needs a book and all painters love art.

**We programmers tend to like websites.**

Coding them can be a pain sometimes, and for a personal portfolio of blog there is not always a need for heavy duty software.

But there is a need for simplicity, clarity, and scalability.

This is why I created Fluff, simple on the surface but built on solid foundations and can grow into anything, or be a devlog perfect to read on rainy days.

This software is free, free as in no cost and also free as in open-source.

You are free to fork this work and use it to build your own website under the MIT license.

You are encouraged to do so and send a screenshot to me [@koalabearfr](https://twitter.com/koalabearfr) on twitter and I'll add screenshots to the repo !!
